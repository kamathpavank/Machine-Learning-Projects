Machin Learining Projects

->Data Preprocessing
  - Data Preparation is an important part of Data Science. It includes two concepts such as Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering. These       two are compulsory for achieving better accuracy and performance in the Machine Learning and Deep Learning projects.
  - Data Preprocessing is a technique that is used to convert the raw data into a clean data set. In other words, whenever the data is         gathered from different sources it is collected in raw format which is not feasible for the analysis.

->Regression based projects

  1.Boston House Price:
   - Predicts the price of houses in boston
   - It is based on Linear Regression Algorithm
   
->Classification Based Projects

   1.Written own classifer:
   
    - This project uses iris dataset
    
    - This project uses classifier written from scratch
    
    - The classifier uses euclidean fornula to calculate the distance of test point from train points
    
    - The classifier gives accuracy around 0.96
